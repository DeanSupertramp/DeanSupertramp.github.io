## Professional experience
- **Electronic Engineer** at [Biotecnomed S.c.a.r.l.](https://www.biotecnomed.it/)


## Education
- Second year student of the **Master's Degree** in Electronics Engineering at Università della Calabria (UNICAL)

- **Bachelor's Degree** in Electronics Engineering at Università della Calabria (UNICAL)
    - Thesis: __IoT Technologies and Cognitive Networks supporting a smart ecosystem capable of determining human activity for improving the quality of life.__


## Projects
- **[Antima.it](https://antima.it/)**:
    - a scientific/technological publications website that I co-found, i manage and publish articles about electronic stuff, diy, 3d printing, Arduino etc...

- **[Convolutore SIMD 3x3](https://github.com/DeanSupertramp/PSD)**:
    - Progettazione, implementazione e simulazione su Vivado di un Convolutore basato su paradigma SIMD 3x3.

- **[Self Balancing Robot](https://github.com/DeanSupertramp/FPSE)**:
    - design and construction of a self-balancing robot.

- **[Device for indoor monitoring of environmental quality](https://github.com/DeanSupertramp/Progettazione_Industriale)**:
    - Conception, design and construction of a smart device suitable for residential contexts, offices, hospitals, gyms, transport, schools, to monitor indoor air quality and in general the environmental parameters associated with it.

- **[Design and simulation of a Differential Pair with Active Load](https://github.com/DeanSupertramp/Progettazione_di_Circuiti_Integrati_Analogici)**:
    - Study, design and simulation in LTSpice of a Differential Pair with Active Load.

- **[Audio event datalogger in LabView](https://github.com/DeanSupertramp/SAM)**:
    - Design and development of a program created in LabView capable of identifying an audio event or not, analyzing its characteristics such as frequency spectrum, duration, saving the data in a log file.

- **[Self-trainer](https://github.com/DeanSupertramp/TPSERS)**:
    - Autonomous monitoring and control system of motor activity: device capable of identifying the movement of a given exercise, through the use of sensors such as accelerometer and magnetometer, ensuring its correctness. Using the relevant app, you can get immediate feedback on the exercise, as well as track, download and monitor your training data through a colorful, dynamic and easy-to-use interface.

- **Final design of an electrical and lighting system for a surveillance office**:
    - Final design of an electrical and lighting system for a surveillance office with relative power factor correction, photovoltaic system and earth system.

- **Py-nesthesia**:
    - An interpreter that simulates the phenomenon of synaesthesia. Written in Python, this software is able to analyze an audio stream, in order to perceive the sequence of notes played by associating them with a sequence of colors which will then be reproduced by an RGB matrix.

- **Theremin**:
    - Realization of a musical instrument based on an ultrasonic sensor and Arduino.
